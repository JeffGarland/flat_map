\section{Motivation and Scope}

There has been a strong desire for a more space- and/or runtime-efficient
representation for \code{map} among C++ users for some time now.  This has
motivated discussions among the members of SG14 resulting in a
paper\footnote{See P0038R0,
  \href{http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0038r0.html}{here}.},
numerous articles and talks, and an implementation in Boost,
\code{boost::container::flat_map}\footnote{Part of Boost.Container,
  \href{http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/container.html}{here}.}.
Virtually everyone who makes games, embedded, or system software in C++ uses
the Boost implementation or one that they rolled themselves.\\

Previous revisions of this paper produced benchmark numbers that show why.
Note that the results revealed that roughly half of the linear runtime cost of
inserting an element into a flat map was refunded when the keys and values
were stored in separate containers (though only for small key and value types).\\
