\section{Motivation and Scope}

There has been a strong desire for a more space- and/or runtime-efficient
representation for \code{std::map} among C++ users for some time now.  This
has motivated discussions among the members of SG14, numerous articles and
talks, and an implementation in Boost, \code{boost::container::flat_map}.
Virtually everyone who makes games, low-level, or embedded-system software
in C++ uses the Boost implementation, or one that they rolled themselves.
