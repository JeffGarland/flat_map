\section{Motivation and Scope}

There has been a strong desire for a more space- and/or runtime-efficient
representation for \code{map} among C++ users for some time now.  This has
motivated discussions among the members of SG14, numerous articles and talks,
and an implementation in Boost, \code{boost::container::flat_map}.  Virtually
everyone who makes games, embedded, or system software in C++ uses the Boost
implementation or one that they rolled themselves.
