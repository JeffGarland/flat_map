\section{Motivation and Scope}

There has been a strong desire for a more space- and/or runtime-efficient
representation for associative containers among C++ users for some time now.
This has motivated discussions among the members of SG14 resulting in a
paper\footnote{See P0038R0,
  \href{http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0038r0.html}{here}.},
numerous articles and talks, and an implementation in Boost,
\code{boost::container::flat_set}\footnote{Part of Boost.Container,
  \href{http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/container.html}{here}.}.
Virtually everyone who makes games, embedded, or system software in C++ uses
the Boost implementation or one that they rolled themselves.\\

This paper represents follow-on work to P0429, ``A Standard \code{flat_map}''.\\
