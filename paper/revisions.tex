\section{Intent}

C++20 will likely have a \tcode{constexpr}-usable \tcode{vector}.  By making
the new flat container adaptors \tcode{constexpr}-friendly, we can have a
\tcode{constexpr}-usable flat containers too.

\section{Dependencies}

The wording in this document is expressed as differences against the current
working draft with P0429 ``A Standard \tcode{flat_map}'' and P1222 ``A
Standard \tcode{flat_set}'' applied.
